    <h3 style="font-family: 'Charmonman', cursive;">This is a website created by Parth, which is obviously the person showing you this website in order to be able to flaunt my HTML5 skills. Hope you like it!</h3>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Charmonman', cursive;">Here is an exquisite image that is a picture from one of the websites that offer open source images: <a href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash.com</a>. It is one of the best resources for images online!</h3>

        <h3 style="font-family: 'Charmonman', cursive;">The website uses only pure HTML and thus it is not responsive and not perfect for viewing across different devices. This may not be the last version of this website and more versions of the same will be developed and changed in the future with awesome new stuff!</h3>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Charmonman', cursive;">Here is a video that wil give you a quick introduction on HTML5! Have a quick look!</h3>

    <h3 style="font-family: 'Charmonman', cursive;">This is a sample form, the information in the form will not be saved but are only meant for purposes of displaying HTML forms:</h3>
    <form style="font-family: 'Charmonman', cursive;">
    First name:
        <input type="text" name="firstname" placeholder="Enter your First Name:"><br><br>
  Last name:
  <input type="text" name="lastname" placeholder="Enter your Last Name:"><br><br>
        
        E-mail address:
  <input type="text" name="lastname" placeholder="Enter your E-mail:"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    
    </form>
        
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Charmonman', cursive;">This website is made only using knowledge of HTML5 and thus lacks any functionality stay tuned for better websites with better functionality and design coming up soon! The next website in my portfolio will be combining HTML5 and CSS3 making a much more comprehensive and well-designed website with better content and breathtaking design stay tuned, awesomeness awaits!</h3>
