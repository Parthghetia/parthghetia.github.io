    <h3>This is a website created only using the knowledge of HTML5. Well for a newbie the first 
        question that always arises is that: What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?
    </h3>
    <h3>Well you know what? That is the first step to web development! Go google mate! I cannot
        spoon-feed you everything! 
    </h3>
    <h3> Before we delve into web development it is important for you to understand that the 
        problems that you would have, someone somewhere has already faced them. Hence just keep
        your mind together, use the right terms and just search it! Anddddddd voila! Your answer
        just as you wanted it will it appear.
